		String description1 = "Description\nThis asset endows the agent with the ability to subjectively evaluate the events that happen in the game world and to \"feel\" emotions in response. This subjective evaluation is done from multiple perspectives, including how desirable was the event for the agent's goals or how blameworthy was the event according to the agent's standards. All events are stored in the agent's memory along with the associated emotional state. This allows the agent to remember and share his emotional experience with the user.\nEmotion Generation:\nEmotions are generated based on the proposed links found in emotion theory between appraisal variables (e.g. desirability, praiseworthiness, etc.) and certain emotion types (e.g. joy, distress, shame). To generate these appraisal variables the asset must be initialized with a set of evaluation rules for all the emotionally-relevant events. These rules can refer to events/actions that are very specific to a given domain (e.g. \"eliminate the queen\" in chess), or they can refer to \"meta-events\" that are internally generated by the agent such as \"goal failure\" or \"norm violated\". The latter type of rules is strongly encouraged to promote generalizability across domains.\nEmotional Thresholds and decay rates:\nApart from the evaluation rules, this asset allows the configuration of an emotional threshold for each possible type of emotion that the agent may experience as well as a decay rate. This allows for an additional level of differentiation between agents concerning their emotional responses. For instance, even if two characters share the same evaluation rules for judging what kind of events makes them angry, one of them can experience much less anger compared to the other just by differentiating their respective anger thresholds. Similarly, one of them can be angry for much longer than the other by differentiating the decay rate they have associated to anger.\nFinally, apart from emotions, the agent's emotional state contains a notion of the agent mood. While emotions have a specific type (satisfaction, distress, etc.) and are usually brief, the mood of the agent only has a valence (positive/negative) and decays much slower to a neutral state. Positive emotions increase the mood of the agent and negative emotions decrease it. When the agent is in a negative mood, it is harder for the agent to experience positive emotions (because the potential will be lower, and the emotion is more likely to be cut off). An analogous effect occurs with characters in good mood.";
