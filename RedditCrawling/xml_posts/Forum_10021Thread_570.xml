My understand is: 1.Student 432 has posted a message at the discussion forum which is numbered as 1. But nobody replied to it. 2. Student 1008 has posted a message at the discussion forum which is numbered as 2, the thread number is 2 as well. Student 1558 has replied to this message. His message number is 3 and he replied to the No.2 Thread. 4.Student 1558 has also initiated a new thread with message number 4, thread no. is 3. He has received many more replies. For example, student 2102 replied to this message DIRECTLY. After that, student 2739 replied to 2102's message. You see, the reponse to number is 5, corresponding to ID=5 of 2102.</Utterance>

In the data file, ""ID"" is the number associated to each posts. For the definition of a thread, if you look at the Coursera forum. This page is one forum thread with multiple posts in it. Note that although we are all posting in the same thread, we are not explicitly responding to each other. If you want to respond to a specific post, you can use the ""+comment"" link in the bottom right corner of each posts. In the data set this is identified by the ""response-to"" column. For the graph, what you will want is to only have ""posters"" as the nodes for the graph. The threads won't appear in the graph. Then, for the links between the nodes, there will be a link between 2 nodes if a poster explicitly answered another one. Note that you need to manipulate the data a little bit if you wan't to find the links. In each row you only have one poster, you need to find which poster this post responded to (if it was a response to another post). You might want to look at VLOOKUP if you want to do this in Excel. I think if you search for VLOOKUP in the coursera forum you can find a post explaining how to use it.</Utterance>
