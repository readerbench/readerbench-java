In question 10, my answer was two nodes, and it was marked wrong. The quiz did not state anywhere that the answer should be in the format of numbers. Just because I did not enter my answers in numerical format ('1' for question 2, and '2' for question 10), marking it wrong is a heavy penalty on my grade. Please rescore and give me the correct grade on this quiz.</Utterance>
