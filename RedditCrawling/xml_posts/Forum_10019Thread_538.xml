My impression here is that you are building your clusters using more than 2 variables. When you look at the scatter plot, you can only see two variables at the same time. So the green point among the red and orange point might be there because this point has values in the other variables that more closely match the green cluster. For the assignment, you should only keep 2 variables (the one selected in question 1).</Utterance>
