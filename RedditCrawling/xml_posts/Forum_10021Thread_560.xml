Crunching numbers is fun but the cherry on the pie is if you visualize the graph in (I think). With networkx you can write the graph to a 'gexf' file which I loaded into Gephi and fiddled around with it (I am by no means a Gephi expert) is this is a result:</Utterance>

Obtained using Gephi - Fruchterman Reingold Layout. Both the nodes and the edges are coloured by their degrees and weights respectively. Brighter the red, higher is the degree or the edge weight as the case may be.</Utterance>
