I just noticed that just like Question 1, I had only connected one of the output ports from the Expectation Maximization Clustering component to Res. Once I connected the other one, I had another tab on the output and could select ""Plot View"" and see Color Column and could select each cluster's probability, so I guess I'm answering my own post...</Utterance>
