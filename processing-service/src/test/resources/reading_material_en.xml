		<p id="0">In this chapter, I shall investigate Wittgenstein's private language argument, that is, the argument to be found in Philosophical Investigations. Roughly, this argument is intended to show that a language knowable to one person and only that person is impossible; in other words, a "language" which another person cannot understand isn't a language. Given the prolonged debate sparked by these passages, one must have good reason to bring it up again. I have: Wittgenstein's attack on private languages has regularly been misinterpreted. Moreover, it has been misinterpreted in a way that draws attention away from the real force of his arguments and so undercuts the philosophical significance of these passages.
		</p>
		<p id="1">What is the private language hypothesis, and what is its importance? According to this hypothesis, the meanings of the terms of the private language are the very sensory experiences to which they refer. These experiences are private to the subject in that he alone is directly aware of them. As classically expressed, the premise is that we have knowledge by acquaintance of our sensory experiences. As the private experiences are the meanings of the words of the language, a fortiori the language itself is private. Such a hypothesis, if successfully defended, promises to solve two important philosophical problems: It explains the connection between language and reality - there is a class of expressions that are special in that their meanings are given immediately in experience and not in further verbal definition. More generally, these experiences constitute the basic semantic units in which all discursive meaning is rooted. I shall refer to this solution as the thesis of semantic autonomy. This hypothesis also provides a solution to the problem of knowledge. For the same reason that sensory experience seems such an appropriate candidate for the ultimate source of all meaning, so it seems appropriate as the ultimate foundation for all knowledge. It is the alleged character of sensory experience, as that which is immediately and directly knowable, that makes it the prime candidate for both the ultimate semantic and epistemic unit. This I shall refer to as the thesis of non-propositional knowledge (or knowledge by acquaintance). 
		</p>
		<p id="2">However, the idea that sensory experiences are supposed to constitute the meanings of the terms of a private language needs explicating, for on the face of it, it is difficult to understand how a red flash, tickle, or pain could be a meaning. A clearer way to express this is to say that the sensory experience is directly correlated with a term. Making this correlation generate a rule of meaning actually masks two assumptions which explicate how we are to understand such peculiar rules: (1) the Naming Assumption: to fix meaning, ostensive baptism of a sensory experience must occur; and (2) the Consistency Assumption: in subsequent use, the objects referred to by the term in question must be of the same kind as the object originally baptized.
		</p>
		<p id="3">Wittgenstein's attack on the possibility of a private language focuses on the legitimacy of such rules of meaning. The upshot of his challenge is that this empiricist solution to the problem of relating language to reality and to the problem of knowledge cannot succeed. The mind, Wittgenstein argues, is not the privileged source of either meaning or knowledge. Roughly, Wittgenstein's strategy is a three-stage affair: an attack on the traditional role that ostensive definition is alleged to play in language acquisition, an attack on the idea that representation requires the existence of special privileged objects, and an attack on the attempt to substitute "reference" for "meaning" as the link between the world and ourselves. If Wittgenstein is correct, reference is no better a philosophical tool for solving the problem of our epistemic relation to the world than was meaning. Both founder ona misconception of representation and knowledge.
		</p>
		<p id="4">These are ambitious aims, with far-ranging implications for theory of language, the character of sensory experience, and the structure of knowledge. Meanings aren't "in the head"; sensory experience isn't transparent and simply "given" to the subject; knowledge isn't grounded in sensory experience. These large philosophical claims aren't established by the private language argument alone as an argument separable from the rest of the Investigations. As I shall show, the private language argument draws on some of the general arguments concerning the nature of language that are developed much earlier in the Investigations. Thus, the rubric "private language argument" is something of a misnomer. Yet the standard interpretation of these passages in the Investigations treats the private language argument as a relatively self-contained argument, fit to join the canon of other great philosophical arguments such as the Ontological Argument or Zeno's Paradoxes. As I shall now argue, the private language argument treated in this way loses its philosophical persuasiveness and becomes embroiled in a debate that leads us away from the important issues and into a blind alley.
		</p>
		<p id="5">Norman Malcolm's early interpretation of the private language argument gives clear expression to the idea that private language fails because it only gives seeming rules for consistent usage. The fundamental error of this interpretation lies in casting Wittgenstein's argument against the Consistency Assumption. Not only is this an incorrect interpretation, it cannot demonstrate the inadequacy of a private language.
		</p>
		<p id="6">The standard empiricist approach to the question of private languages is to claim that the subject can ostensively define his primitive terms and proceed to use them in accordance with the private rule, "I shall call this same thing 'S' whenever it occurs." Both the empiricist and his critic agree that a term cannot be a means of representation unless it can be consistently used. The critic charges that it is impossible to determine whether a private term is being used consistently. The best way to characterize this charge against the empiricist is to let the critic - in this case Malcolm - speak for himself:
		Now how is it to be decided whether I have used the word consistently? What will be the difference between my having used it consistently and its seeming to me that I have? Or has this distinction vanished? "Whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'". If the distinction between "correct" and "seems correct" has disappeared, then so has the concept correct. It follows that the "rules" of my private language are only impressions of rules. My impression that I follow a rule does not confirm that I follow the rule, unless there can be something that will prove my impression correct. And the something cannot be another impression-for this would be "as if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true". The proof that I am following a rule must appeal to something independent of my impression that I am.
		</p>
		<p id="7">Malcolm's argument is intended to show that the Consistency Assumption can be satisfied only if there is some independent check on the application of the rule in question - independent, that is, of the subject's say-so. And that is precisely what the private-language user, ex hypothesi, cannot have: He can only check his seeming to follow a rule correctly by another seeming. But, in this case, the difference between a word's seeming to be correctly applied and its being correctly applied collapses. With this collapse goes the possibility of determining whether the private "rule" is used consistently.
		</p>
		<p id="8">The well-known empiricist answer is to argue that the subject's memory provides an adequate check on the correct, hence consistent, application of a private term. Against this, Malcolm argues that one must be able to distinguish genuine memory from ostensible memory, and if the is/seems distinction collapses at this level, it likewise collapses at the lower level. If such a distinction cannot be drawn, then (citing Wittgenstein for support) "whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'". The rejoinder of the empiricist is to claim that this objection brings into question the reliability of memory itself, a move which equally undercuts his opponent's position since the general reliability of memory must be presupposed whether the checks in question are the subject's own memory or public checks.
